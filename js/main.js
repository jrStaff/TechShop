If this is not the reason you are buying it, there may be better options. The screen is GLOSSY and has lots of reflection and glare.  Plenty sharp, pretty good viewing angles, but brightness is a little low IMO.This is no where near ultrabook size/weight, but it is a fairly light laptop that will travel well.Connectivity!  LAN port with lights!  VGA! Full size HDMI!  USB 3.0 (1), Full size SD reader.  Again, if you don't care about the LAN and full size HDMI/VGA, there may be better options.Keyboard and Trackpad are more than acceptable, maybe even above average IMO.  Caps Lock light, Mute light, full size shift keys, dedicated page up/down, Function keys by default (rather than F keys).There is a fan, and it has been going most of the time I've been using it - not loud or high pitched though. No noticeable heat yet.Replaceable battery!  Its small too, so backups on a trip would be easy to bring.  Not sure about battery life yet, but I've been using it unplugged for almost an hour and am at 88%.Speed?  Not so much.  Will need more time, but I'm certain this is akin to all things \"netbook 2.0\", though 4gb of RAM is better than some.  General web browsing has been fine, but weather.com has become a good test for lesser processors, and it certainly brings this one to a crawl.Read more ›",

I'm not sure where you get that kind of hdd though. It has an extra slot for a 2nd sick of ram too.  Looks like you could add an optical drive if you are willing to modify the case by cutting into the plastic.*edit below*I have added a labeled picture of the board and also a picture of the SATA connectionI could not find a suitable replacement hard drive for this, if you know where I should look let me know, thanks!",

It doesn't feel slow and is easy to use (once you get all the settings to your liking). This isn't a gaming computer even though it seems to play games just fine. It starts fast and wakes up almost instantly. The screen is crisp and clear, not as bright as some may need but it's bright enough for me. It is heavy though at 3 lbs 12.2 oz, I feel that for something with so little storage it should be a pound lighter. No big deal. The keyboard is nice and I wouldn't expect more out of it. The track pad is not quite as nice but when you change the settings to your liking it's much more manageable, but get a mouse for general use. This is a must buy for anyone who wants a chrome book but needs a Windows interface. I use this strictly for Facebook, general webpage maintenance and light gaming. This is all coming from a Mac guy and this is the first Windows computer I have ever bought. I will update if it becomes a slow unusable laptop like others have posted.",

                    "description": "Update: See belowIf you’ve done you comparisons/HW on this laptop, I think you'll find it has one of the best bang per $. As a college student, I appreciate the FHD screen for multi-tasking, reading, and watching videos. You might need to “Change the size of text, apps, and other items:” to use the FHD resolution though. The glossy screen is a fingerprint magnet and makes it prone to sun glare. The chicklet keyboard is pretty decent to type on, even though it's not mechanical ;). Probably the biggest complaint I have is the main storage and APU. While the PC comes with a 32GB SSD which is EMMC quick, only about 28GBs are visible. After Windows 10 updates, Microsoft word, Amazon Kindle(1book), Malwarebytes, CCleaner, and the removal of some bloatware, I only have about 4.2GBs left on the SSD… This can be resolved by simply by plugging in an SD card for additional expansion, but it is not as secure if it were internal storage. The AMD E2 gets the job done for daily office chores and doesn’t have issues with 1080P playback(even @ 60fps), but when it gets burdened with heavy multi-tasking it seems to stutter. With only 4 cores @ 1.8 GHz and sipping 15watts, it was never meant to be a power house, but it gets the job done. The APU is soldered you can’t upgrade it :( . Battery life is 4-6 hours depending on how you use it..R3bel/geek stuff: (I am not responsible for your mistakes!), As one other reviewer found out you ‘probably’ can upgrade this machine if you are comfortable with working on/tearing down laptops(This one is a little tricky, You mess up/make it noticeable, your warranty could be voided.) It might indeed be possible to upgrade to a slim(7mm), 2.5” SSD if you have a female SATA(22pin) to male SilmSATA(13pin) convertor.Read more ›",

For the price, the laptop should be equipped with 8GB DDR4 2133MHz, a 1920x1080p display and a AC Wireless with a decent battery, but like all of HP's standard models, this purposely provides slower single-dimm DDR3 memory which impacts these APUs greatly, a 1336x768 display even though these APUs can easily run 4K displays, a buggy wireless N chip which often has connection issues, a low capacity battery that is lower capacity than a cheap smartphone's battery, and no SSD. Every year, it's the same story with newer AMD processors but the same old budget components and a plastic case that will easily break after a year or two's worth of use.",

Yes.Things I absolutely love about my Lenovo:-The design (You can't just call them stripes on a computer, they give off a feeling of soft wood)  -power button (cute little circle)-Touch screen  -Quick to understand the capabilities of the Lenovo-Light  -Slim-Amount of USB ports (4)  -Sound is pretty good too  -At the bottom of my Lenovo, I love the dots at each corner, so it's easier to moveThings I'm sad about:-Battery Life :3 :( :L ;C-Itunes (Maybe it is just me, but when I tried transferring music from my computer to another device, it wasn't working for a while. I finally noticed that it wasn't reading the cable as apple USB, kept showing MTP. If you ever need help with that, holla at me :)!) Usually, the problem is that not all files were downloaded.Hp comparison: I had a g6 and it lasted long and I could have used it longer, but the battery life was bad. REALLY bad. When I only had it for two years, battery life was only 2-2.5 hours. The body of the laptop was thick, sound quality was so par, and don't get me started with the keys. Plus, there was this rubbery stuff on the face of the computer and at the bottom (Like the Lenovo dots) which were to help if I ever (which I never have) slammed the computer, but fell off within the first year leaving this sticky glue. Plus, it wasn't easy to clean the keys and I like to clean.I hope you cherish your Lenovo because I definitely do!",

I normally use a Chromebook but I needed something that would run Windows because I'm working outside of the US for about 5 months and I need to work remotely, so I had to get a laptop. I chose this one because it has a touch screen, and I'll say, the touch screen certainly does come in handy - every time the touchpad stops working! Sometimes features just stop working, or the laptop itself will freeze and I have to restart it (restart time, in this situation, can take as long as 10 minutes). The webcam is of horrible quality. Sometimes it doesn't work, but most of the time, it shows a very broken, purple image with lines running through it. If you firmly tap the back of the screen several times, you can usually get the picture to clear up. The battery life is pretty disappointing - about 2 hours on a full charge (although, it does charge fast). Fortunately, I bought insurance for this computer. I'm certain it won't last more than a few months.",

I don't use my computer for gaming or anything too demanding, so I wasn't looking for anything really high end. After some research, I decided on to buy this laptop on Prime Day. This is a rather large laptop, and that may make some people want to consider other options. As you would expect, this computer is much faster than what I have been accustomed to. The computer feels sturdy, and has a nice sleek design. The large size allows the keyboard to include a number pad, which is a great daily time saver.  Dolby speakers provide amazing sound quality, especially for a laptop. Sound isn't extremely loud, but more than loud enough. Lenovo didn't put too much bloatware on the computer, which is nice. There are only 2 minor things that I would change about the computer. The CD tray has a really small button, that I have to use the tip of my finger/ fingernail to open. The buttons take a little more effort to press than what I would like, button makes a click noise once pressed. I would prefer something a little lighter, less noise. I generally use a wireless mouse when I can anyway. Overall, great computer, lots of storage. This computer will meet the needs requirements of most users. Will update review as/if things change.",

Great price, lots of wrist space so you're not accidentally typing with your palms; good surface feel when typing. The only con I have is that the front edge of the unit could have been a bit more smooth (there are 2 distinct ridges where your wrists would rest). This is so thin, even with the CD/DVD player, as well as very light. No extraneous buttons or switches; everything is preloaded. I would definitely recommend this.",

It's extremely quiet, and compared to my old laptop the keyboard design is quite refreshing. I used to have issues with dust and hairs getting clogged under the individual keys but it looks like I may not have that issue with this laptop. The laptop itself is sleek, though I'm quite irritated that they placed the headphone jack on the right side instead of out front like every other laptop I've owned. Not a deal breaker, just annoying. My biggest problem is that I've only owned this laptop for two days, and I seem to have a big problem with the touchpad. As of now, I haven't found a solution, but I have discovered it's a common problem. The touchpad freaks out and jumps all over the place like I've got two fingers on it that are moving in the opposite directions while left clicking. I tried to move the cursor, and ended up clicking several links on the page I was on, despite not having clicked anything myself. It stopped on it's own after 30 seconds-a minute, but I wish I would have known about the problem in advance.",

                    "description": "I have a custom built ROG based desktop, so when I searched for a laptop; ROG is what I wanted. I've used the laptop now for 72 hours, here are the factual bullet points:1. Incredible looks2. Super fast without solid state drives3. Minimal \"bloatware.\" It comes with McAfee on it. I'm a Panda guy so I dumped it.4.16 gigs of 2133 DDR4 RAM---ridiculously powerful5. The 960 handles anything 99.9% of the public would ever throw at it flawlessly.6. The matte screen resists glare, big time7. The images are vivid and accurate in color, depth and variation8. The sound is clear and good, not perfect. Laptops are like HD tv's, speakers are their weak link.9. Windows 10 will have to go through several updates, same on any system.10. The keyboard is lit-up red, not gaudy; very elegant. Red is the only color option, that's ROG's color.11. The keys are very firm and responsive, great feel to them.12. More ports than again most of the public would ever need.13. It's \"deadly silent\" while in use.14. ROG's software allows full monitoring of the system. The interface is so simple to follow and read.15. Full 2 year warranty, register it with pride.I cannot say this louder, if you got $1000 to drop on a laptop; there is no better unit out there for that price. Is it cheap, no. Is it worth it, to me; a total no-brain'r; Yes.",

Customizable and does lots of cool stuff.✓ Sleek design which fits in my 18\" laptop bag with room to spare.Cons:x  Comes pre-installed with LOTS of bloatware, which requires a good solid hour to remove entirely.x  Windows 10 by default tracks nearly all of your activity and sends it to unnamed 3rd parties. This also takes a solid hour to disable / defeat.x  Battery life of 3-5 hours, depending on use.Neutral - Some quirks I've noticed:* Keyboard layout is EXTREMELY tight and efficient.* Function keys are mapped for convenience, but a few perform useless functions (for me, at least) such as \"Presentation Mode\".* All USB, audio jack, etc connections are extremely snug and tight. I like it, personally.Personally, I use this computer for video-editing and rendering, as it has a top-notch mobile CPU and GPU. It serves my needs well, is quite fast and efficient, and certainly would excel at rendering modern flashy video games on medium-high settings.",

I purchased the 1tb model without the ssd and im still happy with the purchase. The laptop looks extremely nice and it has a nice sleek aluminum cover as shown in the pictures. It is a bit heavy (around 6.5pounds i believe) , but it has lots of power. For me, it holds a charge for around two hours of normal use. It doesnt lose charge quickly either if you just leave it turned off for a day or more. As long as you are plugged in charging, you wont have a problem and the charging cable is 10 ft. It also came with a small cleaning cloth to clean the screen from lint. One thing that I very much recommend is to buy a wireless mouse, the trackpad and keys can tend to show fingerprints on it easily. I also wanted to purchase a laptop backpack in which there are so many and some claim that they do not fit 17.3 in laptops. After much searching, I found a backpack that the seller wrote that it would fit this laptop. Its called, \"HifiGear Road Warrior Travel Bag 17 - 17.3 Inch Laptop Backpack\" here on Amazon. The laptop fits nicely inside and it doesnt appear to be very large with the laptop inside. I havent had any problems with the laptop. Also, the 1TB hard drive is more like 930 gb. If you feel I have helped you, I would greatly appreciate that you click the helpful button.-Thanks",

Sometimes the red light under the keyboard looks a bit unprofessional, so I tend to turn it if I'm in a meeting. Also, yes, the battery life isn't good, but you should already know that when purchasing this computer. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. For a reasonable price, I got a gaming laptop with a 17.3\" screen and back lit keyboard that is both slim and, relative to other gaming laptops, light (but it is still heavy compared to other small laptops).",

The condition of the laptop I received is phenomenal, minimal wear around a few USB ports and that's it. The keys show no signs of use as well as the case is like new. This is my second system from Joy SYSTEMS and I will definitely be buying more re-certified systems from them. System is super fast, lightweight, nice and cool during use and has a nice look to it. I have always liked Dell systems I think they are good PCs. I just wanted a nice small laptop for my Network Administration course and for streaming movies to the TV. Newegg's 45 day return is great and the warranty program from Joy Systems is a great bonus.",

When paired with a solid state drive these units boot in about 15 seconds!  My customers are always surprised that a 2 - 4 year old laptop can be faster than when they were new!

Removable back cover looks to make upgrades easier.  This setup is fine for our usage.The cover lib looks great with textured almost chrome-like color.  The deck lid is a matt rubberized surface which feels great on the wrists when typing.  The whole system is built very sturdy with no lose our cheap feeling parts.  All ports are working as advertised including the DVD drive.  keyboard is great for typing. sturdy responsive keys. wish the keys were backlit, but knew this going in.

Seems weird, but for those who prefer a wireless mouse this placement gets the touchpad out of the way.  This also allows you to pull the screen closer to your face--important for those of us whose vision is deteriorating with age.\n\nThe negatives are pretty weighty, though.\nThe hinge design is not durable.  I had to have it repaired once under warranty, and it is causing me problems again.  It shorts out when the screen is moved to a certain angle, or when it is bumped or jiggled. A few times now when I reboot, the hard drive goes through a repair sequence.  A little scary! \n\nSo I am now in the market for a new computer.   I wonder if they improved the hinge design with the model that was marketed after mine?",
